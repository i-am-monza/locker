# Application All Projects
This project is a single application that runs three diiferent projects. These projects are:
1. An online calculator accessible through the link 'Simple Calcultor.'
2. A mini store application accessible through the link 'Online Store.'
2. An itunes search application accessible through the link 'Search iTunes.'
You need to have node.js installed before attempting to test or run the application.

## About Applications
Below is a general description of each application.

### - Simple Calculator
The Simple Calculator application is a calculator that evaluates basic operations. The calculator can solve addition, subtraction, multiplication and division expression.
The calculator does not keep track of the previouse result so you cannot evaluate chained expressions.

### - Online Store
This application is a prototype of a mini online store. Only three products are available and a user needs to login first before they can either add to cart, view cart products
or checkout cart. The checkout functionality is not complete. The application checkouts, but unable to process entered coupons or the delivery information after submit order is pressed.
Implimentation of this isn't fully complete. There is functionality that it still lacks, be sure to see fixed bug updates on the following release.

### - Search itunes
This application accesses the itunes search api to look for data. The user enters the item name on the input field, then selects what type of media it on the dropdown for searching.
This application also alows the user to add their favourite items on memory to access later.
The application communicates with a developed server on localhost:8080

## Running/Testing Application
To run or execute the application, double click on the file run_application.bat as administrator on your local machine.
The application will configure the application before opening it.

# Please note: 
I was more focused on the functionality and UI when I was developing the application. The component structure is partly chaotic, did not have time to sort out the aplications
modularity structure, like having complex componets in their own js files. Hope you are impressed, and enjoy playing around with my work. Hope the implimentation excites you as much as it did me. :)
